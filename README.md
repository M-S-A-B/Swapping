Title:Swapping

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: A number can be swapped using the inbuilt function "swap".

Algorithm:

Start =>  declare two variables => then take input of the two variables from user => then print the two variables => then using "swap" function swap the places of those two variables => then again print those two variables =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:
In this code we declare two variables. Then take input of the two variables from user. Then print the two variables. Then using "swap" function swap the places of those two variables, 
then again print those two variables
